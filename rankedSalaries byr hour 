-The included query demonstrates how to retrieve a unique job_id 
for each distinct average hourly salary (salary_hour_avg) from a dataset. 
-It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with a ROW_NUMBER() function to rank entries and filter results, 
ensuring only one representative job_id is returned for each salary value.
