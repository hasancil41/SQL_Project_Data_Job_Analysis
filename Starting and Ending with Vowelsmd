# SQL Query to Filter City Names Starting and Ending with Vowels

## Description

This repository provides a solution for querying a list of city names from a database table named `STATION` where both the first and last characters of the city name are vowels (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). The result is filtered to exclude any duplicates.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
  AND LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
